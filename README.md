# mmtext-for-tmp
To show the correct Burmese (Unicode) text in Text Mesh Pro Unity.

The original repo is https://github.com/mgthantzin/mmfont.Net, and I fixed some issues to display the correct font in Unity with Text Mesh Pro. 

Text Mesh Pro doesn't support "contextual shaping" or "ligatures" yet, It is only available in the TMP v3.2.0 preview version. In Burmese font, it uses a lot of "contextual shaping" based on the characters. We cannot use TMP Text directly.
